// plan-expect.mjs -- an apply is bound to what its plan showed (face v2 Phase 05, ADR-1340 as amended by PR 3a).
//
// A plan is read, then applied up to fifteen minutes later. Between the two, the spine or main can move, and an apply
// that re-derived its write from the world as it then stood wrote something the owner never saw. The PR 3a logic
// attack found this in two places: a driver switch planned against one router and written against another, and an
// experiment opened past its concurrency cap because the cap was counted only at plan time.
//
// So a tool whose apply re-derives what it writes prints, as the LAST line of its plan, the digest of exactly what the
// apply would write:  {"expect":"<64 hex>"}. The door carries that digest into the apply as `--expect <digest>`. The
// apply re-derives everything, re-runs every check, and writes only if the digest is unchanged. Otherwise it refuses
// PLAN_STALE and writes nothing. A hand-run works the same way: the plan prints the flag to add.
