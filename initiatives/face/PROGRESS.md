> Tracker for the cycle planned in `PLAN.md`. Rows flip ✅ only via `/arc-phase-done` from the

> **ADR 1318–1336** from the face band 1300–1399; before writing them the claim was swept across

## Phase table

| Phase | Capability | Appetite | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 00 | Harness steel thread — v0.7 intake + contract + delta report; `npm ci` + build on every Node ≥20.19 leg; ported smoke opens all 34 served rooms | 2d | spec'd — waits on kickoff approval |
| 01 | Tokens + kit — two moods, computed contrast, generated copy, kit on Tailwind v4, 9 bespoke rooms × 2 moods (REQ-02) | 2d | spec'd |
| 02 | Shell + module frame — v0.7 shell, `face/src/modules/`, two-way reconcile, `face-pure`, `/arc-face-module` (REQ-03) | 2d | spec'd |
| 03 | The 36 modules read-side — five ring PRs, each with its `NOT SERVED` list (REQ-01, REQ-05) | 7d | spec'd |
| 04 | Door read routes — what Phase 03's lists name (REQ-06) | 3d | spec'd |
| 05 | Work door + verbs + flows in CI + coverage op-side (REQ-04, REQ-07, REQ-09) | 4d | spec'd — needs owner rulings §13 items 4, 5 |
| 06 | Session door — click-started, streamed, receipted (REQ-08) | 2d | spec'd |
| 07 | Dogfood 2 real days on the final surface + retro (REQ-10) | 2d | spec'd |

**Appetite burn: 0d of 24d.** Blocks: A · look (00–02) 0/6d · B · rooms + truth (03–04) 0/10d ·
C · verbs (05–06) 0/6d · dogfood (07) 0/2d. Tripwires: Block A day 3 · Block B day 5 · 50% of total
at 12d.

**Usage trend (read at every Phase 03 ring close, never counted toward REQ-10):** — not started.

## Inherited from Cycle 15

- REQ-10 (dogfood) → this cycle's Phase 07 at a two-day bar (ADR-1329).
- Room sweep findings F1 (ADR band map names rooms, not lanes) · F2 (scheduler lede over-promises) · F3 (planned `trader` wears LIVE) → Phase 03 rings (`initiatives/face/archive/evidence-cycle15-2026-09-16/phase-09/room-sweep-by-eye.md`).
- ADR-1315's voice trigger — the v0.7 dock ports text-only; the question is asked at the Phase 07 retro.
- Cycle 15 assumption row 5 (timing vs Inbox shape) → PLAN assumptions ledger row 7.
- `approval.requested{gate: phase-done}` `01M2NJ5F736X7PNRD68H5DVYPG` for Cycle 15's Phase 09 close is still waiting on the owner's stamp.
- Not this lane's work, recorded so it is not lost: the approved `[phase-orphan]` kickoff-lint group (its own `/arc-change` PR, `docs/trial-ledger.md` 2026-09-16) · the vacuous `tests/portfolio-board.bats` archive assertion (portfolio lane, ADR-1332).

## Done log

- **2026-09-16 — Cycle 16 kickoff (`/arc-kickoff --lane face`).** Cycle 15 archived in-lane
  (ADR-1332). 19 ADRs written: 1318–1331 record FV2-A…N as LOCKED; 1332–1336 are the kickoff's own
  forks. Owner rulings at kickoff: appetite **24 days → Tier L**; **P06 kept** (REQ-08 "stamp
  survives" becomes a Non-negotiable + Phase 05 exit, the freed REQ measures the session door);
  **browser tests on every Node ≥20.19 leg**, Node 18 a counted skip. Found while planning: v0.7's
  flows assert 29 event kinds arc does not have (ADR-1334); CI has never built L3 and Node 18 cannot
  (ADR-1335) — so the harness moved into Phase 00 as the steel thread (ADR-1336); ADR-1308's text
  does not contain the generated-token rule the cycle cites it for (noted in ADR-1318).
  **Gates.** `kickoff-lint` passes (one honest WARN: phase appetites = 100% of 24d). Attack panel ×3
  returned 19 findings: A 7 · B 5 · C 7 — applied (several reworded to fit): real-Chrome error
  control, a named throwing-room baseline, a Node-20-below-20.19 skip that FAILs, concurrent
  idempotent `apply`, REQ-01 BELOW-BAR, attacker time inside phase days, a Phase 05 day-1 CLI probe,
  the shard-table collision protocol, REQ-08 covering all three sessions, the CLAUDE.md command count,
  Preconditions lines in every spec, facts-bundle attackers bound to the shipping ring PR, a
  `face-pure` JSX-branch assumption, realpath main-guards, and a Standing-decisions list.
  Re-verification: Vite 8 and Node `WebSocket` claims VERIFIED; the Chrome claim PARTLY WRONG
  (`windows-latest` = Server 2025, `macos-latest` = macOS 26 arm64, `CHROME_BIN` contested) —
  ADR-1335's lookup no longer depends on it. Second opinion (Codex CLI 0.147.0): **DISAGREE** on a
  36-vs-41 room count; resolved by measuring the inventory (PLAN § Module inventory) and all 10
  findings applied (`docs/reviews/2026-09-17-second-opinion-face-v2-kickoff.md`). **Simulation gate:
  round 1 = 5 blockers, round 2 = 2 blockers** (smoke compared against served incl. the `lane`
  template; no id→ring source). Both fixed from measured data — ring from the served registry,
  "openable" = non-template entries (33) — but **not re-verified by a third run**: two non-zero rounds
  make this the owner's call, raised with the approval.
  REJECTED: exempt `--accent-dim` from the Phase 01 contrast gate — unsupported
  REJECTED: a new quoting lint for the harness scripts — already-covered
  REJECTED: the Node-patch check as a replacement for assumptions row 7 — already-covered
  REJECTED: cut absorb read and hire certification from Phase 06 — already-covered
  REJECTED: other lanes' CLIs as an External-dependencies row — already-covered
  REJECTED: pre-existing ADRs appended into the Key decisions index — non-actionable
  Receipts (main clone spine): `kickoff.done` `01M2NS0A8Y7SPQW8NNJ19Y7AZZ` ·
  `approval.requested{gate: kickoff}` `01M2NS0AK4KN8JR10QDT2F72HP`.

## Now

**Position (2026-09-17):** Cycle 16 is **APPROVED** — the owner's `decision.recorded`
`01M2NS8Y48Y91RFZJVA32VNH17` (verdict approve, reason "Face V2 Kickoff approved") answers
`approval.requested{gate: kickoff}` `01M2NS0AK4KN8JR10QDT2F72HP` on the main clone's spine. The
approval was given with the simulation gate's two non-zero rounds on the table (round-2 blockers
fixed, not re-run). No product code exists for this cycle yet. The kickoff docs ride
`feat/face-v2-kickoff` to `main`.

**Next step:** the kickoff PR goes green on CI per job and merges; then open `feat/face-v2-00` and
start Phase 00 (intake + harness steel thread) — its Preconditions line is satisfied by the
decision above plus that merge.
