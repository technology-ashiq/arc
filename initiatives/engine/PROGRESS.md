## Phase table

| Phase | Capability | Appetite | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 00 | Steel thread — **parked, shipped in Cycle 6** (canonical process layer, `arc-run`, driver contract, `router.yaml`) | — | ✅ done 2026-08-03 |
| 04 | The law, and proof the hands exist — mandate receipt, ADR-0212 merged, runtime installed behind a container backend, ONE live headless invocation, **or the STOP fires** | 1 day | pending |
| 05 | The shim — `drivers/hermes` on the real 3-code contract, `drivers/mock` replay, two-surface adversarial pass on the output parser | 1.5 days | pending |
| 06 | **Certification or STOP** — 12 fixtures green against the real runtime with receipts, plus the scrubbed-transcript evidence path | 2 days | pending |
| 07 | The hire — ONE reviewed `router.yaml` diff carrying the policy row and termination spec, the capped key, the calibration baseline | 1 day | pending |
| 08 | The job — draft process authored, context-pack flow, ≥3 real runs with per-draft verdicts, a hand-written results table, retro and seal | 1.5 days | pending |

**Appetite burn: 0.0 of 7.5 days used (0%).** Phases allocate 7 of 7.5 — **93%, and the half-day of
slack is thin**, flagged by `kickoff-lint` and left honest rather than padded. The design source's
"1.5 weeks (8 working days)" rounds up: 1.5 weeks is 7.5 working days at a 5-day week, so the cap is
written as the smaller, true number. Kill checkpoint is read at **day 5**, not at the 50% mark of
3.75 — 50% falls inside Phase 06 while it is still on schedule, and a tripwire that fires on an
on-track run is one that learns to be ignored.

## Done log

- 2026-08-12 — `/arc-kickoff --lane engine`. Cycle 6 archived; `PLAN.md`, 5 phase specs and **ADRs
  0208–0219** written; `kickoff-lint` green. **No code.** Awaiting owner approval.
  - Owner answered three forks in-session: **Hermes Agent, container-backed** (EXE-A) · **OpenRouter
    capped key** (EXE-F) · **arc's own build-out journey** as the draft subject (REQ-07).
  - Four agents ran before the plan was written — a codebase survey and three researchers (runtime
    scorecard, agent-runtime supply-chain threat model, hard-capped credential landscape).
  - **Five drift items** found against the design source's 2026-08-09 snapshot, the largest being
    that the ENG-D exit map it calls "inherited" **does not exist** — the real contract is
    `{ OK: 0, DRIVER_FAIL: 1, BUDGET_DECLINED: 2 }` and there is no data-boundary concept at any
    layer, while the certification suite asserted `exit 5` twice. Resolved by ADR-0219 rather than
    discovered in Phase 05.
  - **The two researchers disagreed** on the chosen runtime's security record and the disagreement is
    recorded rather than averaged: one found ≥12 aggregator CVEs with vendor silence, the other
    fetched the vendor's advisories page live and found zero published. Recorded in ADR-0208's
    Evidence and Confidence lines and in the rabbit holes.
  - **Attack panel: 3 fresh agents, 21 findings, 19 accepted, 1 rejected, 1 stale.** The four that
    mattered were ordering defects: the capped credential was provisioned a phase *after* the
    fixtures that consume it (which could have fired the STOP for a scheduling bug rather than an
    isolation gap); the data-boundary mechanism was certified in Phase 06 but built in Phase 08; the
    adversarial pass was bound to the phase close rather than the shipping PR; and the pre-decided
    cut named an artifact no spec produced. Rejected: bumping Phase 06 to 2.5d — `out-of-appetite`.
  - **Simulation gate: 18 blockers on round 1, 6 live on round 2** (a seventh was already closed by an
    edit the simulator did not see). Two non-zero rounds is the gate's escalation point. All six were
    mechanical rather than judgement calls and were closed — the spine-payload contract, the vetting
    OK format and date, the wait protocol for owner acts, the appetite clock epoch and unit, the CI
    shard-timing and count-floor mechanics, and the STOP record location. **They are closed but NOT
    re-verified by a third simulator round**, because the gate permits one respawn. Round-1 count for
    the retro scoreboard: `sim-blockers-r1 18`.
  - **One defect caught that would have quarantined a receipt:** `decision.recorded` is not a
    standalone kind. Its payload is closed to `decides`/`verdict`/`reason`, and `decides` must be the
    ULID of the `approval.requested` it decides. The design source, the Phase 0 description and the
    first draft of this spec all had the mandate landing as a single `decision.recorded` — which
    exits 0 and quarantines silently, this lane's own recorded failure.

## Now

**Current position, 2026-08-12: the plan exists and is NOT yet approved. Zero days burned, zero code
written, nothing installed, no credential provisioned.**

`/arc-kickoff` has produced `PLAN.md`, `phases/phase-04-spec.md` through `phase-08-spec.md`, and
twelve ADRs (0208–0219) covering EXE-A…K plus one decision the design source did not anticipate.

**The approval id is `01KZTG8B82Q6HT4472Q288GCJ1`** (`kickoff.done` is `01KZTG835C356GPN7452603ZZX`).
Both were emitted from the canonical clone at `E:/Work_Hub/01_Automemory/arc` — this worktree has its
own gitignored spine and the emitter refuses to write there, because a receipt written in a worktree
is real, valid and invisible to `arc-inbox`. Both verified present in `events/` and absent from
`_quarantine/`. To record the decision:

```
cd E:/Work_Hub/01_Automemory/arc && arc-inbox approve 01KZTG8B82Q6HT4472Q288GCJ1 --reason "..."
```

**Next step: the owner approves or amends the plan.** On approval, Phase 04 opens with
`/arc-develop start 4 --lane engine` — and its first act is the ADR-0212 amendment merging *before*
any routing row exists, because a `router.yaml` row for a runtime is meaningless until the policy it
implements says what a runtime is.

**Three owner acts gate Phase 04, and none of them is code.** The Docker daemon must be running (it
is installed and currently down); the runtime must be installed at tag `v2026.8.3`; and an OpenRouter
capped key needs a **ceiling figure the owner names** — deliberately not invented here, following
ADR-0069 block (d)'s own refusal to fabricate a spend threshold. The key itself is not needed until
Phase 07, but the first two are Phase 04's exit criteria.

**Why Phase 04 looks different from the design source's Phase 0.** The source's Phase 0 was law only
— ADRs, the amendment, the runtime pick on paper. This lane's previous cycle closed with its central
claim unproven for exactly one reason: nothing runnable was installed and no credential existed, and
that was discovered at Phase 03 rather than Phase 00. So REQ-00 makes one live headless invocation a
Phase-04 exit criterion. If the runtime cannot run on this machine, EXE-A's STOP fires at 1 day
burned instead of 5.
